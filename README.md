# Multimodal Language Model Assignment

## Overview

This assignment explores the capabilities and applications of multimodal language models, which can process and generate content across different modalities such as text, images, and video. Through a hands-on Google Colab notebook, you'll implement and demonstrate various use cases of multimodal language models, providing a comprehensive code walkthrough explaining the implementation details and outputs.

## Assignment Options

You have two options for this assignment:

### Option 1: Transformers for Vision and Multimodal LLMs

Based on materials from "Hands-on Large Language Models":
- Implement vision transformers and multimodal language models
- Demonstrate various vision-language tasks
- Explore the architecture and capabilities of multimodal transformer models
